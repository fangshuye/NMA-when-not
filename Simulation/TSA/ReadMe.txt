V1:
5000 simulations, for selecting the information size

V2:

10,000 simulations, 
calculating type I error rate under different adjustment method (with or w/o alpha boundary) and 2 criteria of promising result

V3:

100,000 simulations,
calculating type I error rate under different adjustment method (with or w/o alpha boundary) and 
3 ways of generating new dataset (2 criteria of promising result and 1 independent)

V4:
100,000 simulations
Add type I error rate when we analyze it individually.

V5:
100,000 simulations
Change the comparison from 'GAMI - FLOR' to 'CEFTH - TRIM', which is to keep the same as the simulation without TSA.
We would apply TSA to network meta-analysis now instead of meta-analysis in V1-V4
233 + 180
Estimated p of CEFTH: 0.39
Estimated p f TRIM: 0.55
